## Abstract

Campus Pulse is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to manage and streamline campus events within academic institutions. The system enables administrators to publish events and students to browse, register, and manage participation through a digital ticketing mechanism.

A strict **one-ticket-per-user-per-event** policy ensures controlled access, while profile-based ticket generation maintains data accuracy. The application improves student engagement and reduces administrative workload through automation.

## Introduction

Educational institutions regularly organize academic, cultural, and technical events. Conventional event management systems often rely on manual processes and fragmented communication, leading to inefficiency, data inconsistency, and increased administrative burden.

Campus Pulse addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, mobile-first platform that automates event publishing, registration, and ticket management through a clean and intuitive interface.

---

## System Overview

Campus Pulse is a role-based mobile application designed for two primary stakeholders:

- **Administrator**
- **Student (User)**

The application follows a modular architecture and employs a bottom navigation layout to ensure seamless accessibility of core features.

---

## Functional Requirements

### User Module

- View all available campus events
- Register for events using the **Join Now** option
- Enforced single-ticket policy per event
- Automatic ticket generation using profile data
